ContextVox
===========

ContextVox is a plug-in for Eclipse that helps blind and visual impaired programmers. Is an mediator level between the IDE and the screen reader.

Key features
-------------

Some feature of the current and future releases:

- Translate programming code into more discorsive way
- Provides extra information when browsing the GUI (e.g. package explorer view, outline, etc)
- Sound API for icons, such as error markers or breakpoints
- Command line for executing tedious task programmatically, such as selecting code or jumping
- View jump shortcuts


State of the project
---------------------

Actually the project is under rebase: this is due to place a milestone between old (and buggy) code and a new life of the project.

The plug-in currently supports only the Java language, but in the future is planned to extend the palette to other programming languages such as PHP or C/C++.
